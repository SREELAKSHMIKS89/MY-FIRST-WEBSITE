        <p id= "info_my_fav_place">I LIKE TIRUMALA BECAUSE, I LOVE THE PLACES WHERE WE HAVE AN GOOD OPPURTUNITY TO LEARN SOME NEW THINGS WHICH I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE. I LIKE HOW THEY ARRANGE THINGS VERY WELL IN THE TEMPLE. I LIKE HOW THEY OFFER FOOD FOR FREE IN A RESTAURANT I WENT WITH MY FAMILY. IT WAS WONDERFULL. I LIKE TO SPEND SOME DAYS THERE ENJOYING THE NATURE AND PRAYING THE GOD.</p>
